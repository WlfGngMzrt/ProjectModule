1. Difference Between CRUD Repository and JPA Repository

-> JPA Repository is the superset of the CRUD Repository
    CRUD Repo only contains CRUD Operations
    JPA Repo contains the CRUD as well as Pagination and Sorting

2. Difference between POJO and bean

POJO -> Plain Old Java Object

Bean -> Object which is inside a Spring IOC container, this has our beans

1. JPA Mappings

    i. One to Many Relation Mappings
    Imagine the a case where we need relationship between a customer and
    order.

    A customer will have the list of all their orders, but one order
    must not contain all the customers who have that order

    Customer ------ Order
    1           :       M  ------> uni-directional from customer end


    @JoinColumn & @MappedBy

    1. JoinColumn : we dont want to have a third table we want to have a join
                    by a column not by the mapping table. We have to tell by which
                    column.

    Note :

    Unidirectional Mapping :

    @OneToMany -> DB -> PK of the 1 side goes as the FK into the M side.

    @ManyToOne -> by default the pk of the 1 side goes as the fk in the M side
    @OneToMany -> by default, creates a mapping table

    @JoinColumn with @OneToMany -> to specify pk of the 1 side goes as fk into
                                   M side
                      convention to join column -> tableName_idFieldName


    2. MappedBy : Only in bidirectional mapping
                  Defines the owning side of the mapping

       ex : let us day we have 3 product in the "electronics" category
       now for us, if we delete a product it should not delete the whole category
       also if we delete a category it should not delete all corresponding products
       (technically yes since there is so such category, but better practice
       is to first chane the products category and then delete the category).
